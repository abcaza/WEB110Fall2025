				<p>Hi, my name is Amsi Cazares! I am curently studying at JCCC, working on my associates of aplied sciences for the 
				Automotive Technology program. I am on my last semester before I graduate, so I am super excited to finish 
				and see what the future holds.</p>
				<p>Throughout my years of study, I've dived in into many different subjects, for example, in high school I was in the Medical
				Profession academy, because before deciding to be a mechanic, I wanted to be a Pediatrician. So, I gave four years into the study of biology,
				which is something that still interests me for later in the future. I was also in robotics and science olympiad, really fun courses. 
				I honestly love to dive in into any hands-on learning and STEM.</p>
				<p>Before diving into the project that I have been working on for a while. I am going to talk a little bit 
				about the program and let you know what type of labs and projects we do while in the program. At the very 
				end, I will provide the link of the program, in case you interested in learning more or joining the program too. </p>
				
				<p> If you guys have an questions, you can contact me through instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/"
