<!--A little background story on how I got my Camaro and how I chose it.-->
			<h2>5th Gen Camaro RS</h2>
	<br>
				<p> Ever since I got myself involved with cars, I thought to myself "What is car that 
				I really want to own one day?". I looked into just common cars like Accords, Camrys, 
				and so on but I wanted something that spoke 'cargirl'. I started looking into mustangs, challengers 
				and chargers but none of them really grabbed my attention. Until one day, I was driving and saw a Camaro. A girl driving 
				a Camaro and I thought to myself "Omg, I found it, I love it, she's a baddie." And ever since, I really wanted one. </p>
				
				<p> One day on my way back from work, I get a call from a towing service that they were going to drop off a car
				and I was already use to getting those calls since my dad buys cars off an auction and I help him fix them. So, to me it was
				"another day, another car".</p>
				
				<p> Little did I know it was going to be my first Camaro as my project car. And little by little I started rebuilding the front
				and the airbag (since that was the only damage). Soon enough, it was time for the test drive and it felt amazing. 
				Words could not describe the adrendaline that was running throughout my body that day. </p>
				
				<p> Now I want to show you the process, its really dope and I want to share it!!</p>
				
<!--The following will be pictures of my Camaro and the timeline of how I fixed it (with the dates as well-->

			<h2> Timeline:</h2> 
			
				<h3>April 25th, 2025</h3>
					<img src="start.jpg" width= "450" height= "350" alt="The Camaro being dropped off." class="start.jpg">
						<p>It arrived and I was literally tearing up because it was the color I wanted and it was perfect
						in my eyes.</p>
					<img src="damaged.jpg" width= "550" height= "350" alt="Damaged parts of the Camaro." class="damaged.jpg">
					<img src="front.jpg" width= "450" height= "350" alt="Front of the Camaro with damage." class="front.jpg">
						<p>I started looking around to see what kind of repairs it needed and noting what the cost of the 
						repairs would be.</p>
					<img src="side.jpg" width= "550" height= "350" alt="The side of the Camaro with no damage." class="side.jpg">
					<img src="airbag.jpg" width= "450" height= "350" alt="Inside of the Camaro with popped airbag" class="airbag.jpg">
						<p>The side and rear side had little to no body damage which was great news because we only have to focus in the 
						front. The inside had a minor airbag issue.</p>
		<br>
				<h3>April 28th, 2025</h3>
					<img src="hood2.jpg" width= "450" height= "450" alt="Making sure that the hood arrive correctly." class="hood2.jpg">
					<img src="hood.jpg" width= "550" height= "450" alt="Me working on the attachment of the hood." class="hood.jpg">
					<img src="bumper.jpg" width= "450" height= "450" alt="Seeing if the bumper fit the front of the car." class="bumper.jpg">
						<p>I am making sure that all the parts that arrive fit the car and is the same color (eventhough we are
						 going to paint it later on.</p>
		<br>			
				<h3>May 5th, 2025</h3>
					<img src="carwash.jpg" width= "450" height= "350" alt="Took the Camaro to the carwash to give it a clean up. " class="carwash.jpg">
						<p>Literally so excited because it was the first time we took it out the parking eventhough it was just for a clean up.</p>
		<br>			
				<h3>May 31st to present</h3>
					<img src="clean1.jpg" width= "450" height= "450" alt="First day, cleaned and painted. All ready to go for a spend." class="clean1.jpg">
					<img src="clean2.jpg" width= "450" height= "450" alt="Most recent picture (October 20, 2025). I always enjoy driving it." class="clean2.jpg">
						<p>My Camaro was finally finished and ready to be taken on a spend. I also teared up when I saw it all complete. 
						Best day of my life.</p>
