			<h2>Introduction... to the Camaro </h2>
					
				<p>
				The Chevrolet Camaro is one of the most recognized American muscle cars in 
				automotive history. First introduction in 1966, the Camaro was designed to compete 
				directly with the Ford Mustang and that quickly made them know for power, performance, 
				and aggressive styling. Over the years, the Camaro has made an impact into a cultural icon, 
				appearing in movies, racing events, and car shows around the world.

				<p>The Chevrolet Camaro is classified as a performance-focused American muscle car. 
				Known for its strong engines, sporty handling, and bold design, the Camaro has earned a 
				reputation as one of the most exciting and affordable performance cars available. It comes
				in several trims, ranging from simple daily-driving models to high-performance versions 
				capable of competing with sports cars far above its price range.

			<h2>Generations</h2><!--Wanted to explain a bit about the generations of the camaro-->
			<img src="generations.jpg" width= "450" height= "350" alt="generations of the Chevy Camaro"  class="generations.jpg">
			
				<p>Over six generations, the Camaro has evolved in looks, performance, and technology. 
				Early models from the late 1960s are known for their classic muscle car style, while later 
				generations incorporated more advanced engineering and sharper, more modern designs. The 5th 
				and 6th generations helped revive the Camaro’s popularity with updated powertrains, improved 
				handling, and aggressive styling that returned the car to its performance roots.

			<h2>Why did I choose Camaro for my topic?</h2>
			<img src="mycamaro.jpg" width= "450" height= "350" alt="my 2015 Camaro RS"  class="mycamaro.jpg">
				<p>I chose the Chevrolet Camaro because it represents everything I find interesting 
				about cars: bold design, the LOVE I have for Camaros and trong performance. The Camaro is a car many people recognize, and it has a passionate community 
				behind it. I also wanted to learn a little more about the Camaro world, so as you are learning, I have learned as
