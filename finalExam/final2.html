	<h2>Generations through the years</h2>
	
		<ol><!--Decided to put them in list forms so it is easier to style with the CSS-->
			<li><p><b>First Generation (1967–1969):</b> The very first Camaro came out as Chevy’s response to the
			Ford Mustang and it made a huge impact. It had that true American muscle-car attitude with 
			bold styling, strong performance, and V8 options. This generation is still one of the most iconic today.</p></li>
		
			<li><p><b>Second Generation (1970–1981):</b> This generation has a full redesign, making the Camaro 
			longer, lower, and wider. Chevy leaned more into making the ride comfortable and being able to handle it instead of just raw 
			muscle power. The convertible was removed, but the Camaro still kept its sporty feel while 
			becoming more refined.<p></li>
		
			<li><p><b>Third and Fourth Generations (1982–2002):</b>These generation made Camaro closer to the 
			“sporty coupe” category rather than the classic muscle-car style. Emissions rules, fuel 
			economy changes, and new technology made an impact on the design. Even though performance shifted, 
			the Camaro stayed recognizable and continued to evolve.</p></li>
		
			<li><p><b>Fifth Generation (2010–2015):</b> After being discontinued, the Camaro made a huge 
			comeback. Chevy brought back a modern car with a retro-inspired look, mixing the best of both 
			worlds: the classic design and modern engineering. This generation helped bring the Camaro back 
			into the spotlight and reminded everyone why the Camaro name matters.</p></li>
		
			<li><p><b>Modern Era; Sixth Generation (2016–2024):</b> The newest generation introduced a lighter, 
			more advanced platform that improved handling and performance. Engine options ranged from a 
			turbocharged 4-cylinder to V6, V8, and even supercharged V8 models. Whether someone wanted a 
			practical daily driver or a serious performance car, there was a Camaro for almost everyone.</p></li>
		</ol>

	<h2>Trim Levels</h2><!--again made them into a list so it is easier to manage-->
			<p>Some trim levels focus on speed, while others focus on comfort or features. From the basic 1LT to 
			the powerful ZL1, the Camaro offers these types of trims whether you want a car that’s easy to drive,
			packed with tech, or built for raw performance. </p>
			
		<ol>
			<li><b>1LT (basic):</b> entry-level, V6 engine which is basic but decent features.</li>
			
			<li><b>2LT (comfort upgrade): </b>has a nicer interior, adds more comfort like better seats (heated/ventilated) 
			and dual zone climate.</li>
			
			<li><b>3LT (tech and luxury):</b> higher tech comfort, also based in the V6 engine, an upgraded infotainment, 
			nicer audio and extra features.</li>
			
			<li><b>LT1 (first V8 performance):</b> has a V8 engine for stronger acceleration and more power, keeping interior 
			features simple.</li>
			
			<li><b>1SS (sporty V8):</b>has performance brakes, bigger wheels, and tires for aggressive driving experience.</li>
			
			<li><b>2SS (power and comfort):</b>also with V8 power, has luxury features like leather seats, heated/ventilated seats, 
			and premium audio.</li>
			
			<li><b>ZL1 (top muscle performance): </b>supercharged V8, track-ready suspension and brakes, for the ultimate fast and 
			thrilling Camaro experience.</li>

			<p>In simple terms, the <b>bigger</b> the engine, the more <b>power</b> and speed the Camaro can produce. 
			Smaller engines are easier to drive and more fuel-efficient, while larger V8 engines makes the 
			car more famous muscle-car performance. No matter which engine you choose, the Camaro is still fun and exciting
